## Description

Cyber Maze: Node Run

The purpose of the game is to go through the maze and get to the exit.

You control the player using WASD

The player must step on 3 yellow nodes to unlock the exit. There is a 10 second time limit, and if the player doesn't make it to the exit on time, they lose and must either restart the level, or go to the next one.
