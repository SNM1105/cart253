## Description

Cyber Maze: Limited

The purpose of the game is to go through the maze and get to the exit.

You control the player using WASD

The player must make it to the end of the maze, but they only have 20 moves to do it! Try and make it before you run out of moves. If you get stuck, you can restart, or skip the level!

The way that the maps are generated makes it so not every level is actually solvable. To combat this, there is a "Skip Level" button that lets you skip the level and play a new one.

Try and get the best score you can!
