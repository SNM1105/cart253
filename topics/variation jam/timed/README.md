## Description

Cyber Maze: Time Crunch

The purpose of the game is to go through the maze and get to the exit.

You control the player using WASD

The player must make it to the end of the maze before the 10 second timer runs out. Once the player makes it to the exit, their score goes up by one and they're taken to the next level.

The way tha the maps are generated makes it so not every level is actually solvable. To combat this, there is a "Skip Level" button that lets you skip the level and play a new one.
